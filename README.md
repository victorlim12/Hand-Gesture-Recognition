# DIP-EE44

Our DIP Project is titled "Robust Hand Gesture Recognition using Neural ODE Networks". The team explored the usage of Neural ODE to provide solutions to patients with hand disabilities (mainly focusing on Parkinson's Disease symptomps, hand tremor). In order to provide an implementable solutions for these patients, we are looking into the implementation of rehabilitation software consisting of three different components. 

As of current:
- Model_Comparison: To compare models with ODE layers against those without
- Frontend + Backend: Web application used for our project
